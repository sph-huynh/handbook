The UNIHACK Judging Panel will determine all entries based on the following
criteria:

**Originality**  
Is the hack more than just another generic social/mobile/local app? Does it do
something entirely novel, or at least take a fresh approach to an old problem?

**Technical Difficulty**  
Is the hack technically interesting or difficult? Is it just some lipstick on
an API, or were there any technical challenges to surmount when building it?

**Polish and Design**  
Is the hack usable in its current state? Is the user experience smooth? Does it
work as the creators say? Is it well designed? Our judges will see and/or want
to use your prototype - so make sure it works!

**Usefulness**  
Is the hack practical? Is it something people would actually use? Does it fulfil
a real need that people have? While you are not required to prepare a business
plan, your app should have an audience identified.

Please note that the above judging criteria only applies for the Major Prize.
Teams will be judged on their *Polish and Design* marks for the Best Design
prize; and on their *Originality* marks for the Most Creative Idea prize.

All other prizes have their own judging criteria, eligibility requirements and
judges. More information will be released closer to the date of the hackathon.
