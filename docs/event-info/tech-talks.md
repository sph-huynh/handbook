We have organised a number of tech talks across the [Mixer Night](../mixer-night.md) on July 26 and the [main event](schedule.md) on July 30-31.

These are 30 minute talks presented by some of our sponsors that are designed to help you with the competition, gain knowledge and/or refresh existing skills. Previous topics included "Introduction to UX Design", "Being a Great Software Engineer in the Real World", and "How to win UNIHACK".

We ask teams to send at least *one* representative to each tech talk. The full list of Tech Talks will be made available closer to the start of the event.
