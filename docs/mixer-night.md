![Mixer Night](../img/mixernight-head.jpg)

This year, for the first time, we are introducing a Mixer Night on July 26.

The Mixer Night will feature industry experts presenting talks that will prep you before the main event and ensure you and your team are ready. Some mentors will make an appearance to help you fine-tune your idea.

This will also be an opportunity for people to find team members. So if you are looking, then we highly suggest you attend!

The Mixer Night begins at 6:00pm on July 26. We ask that each team send at least
one representative to the event, and that you RSVP before July 15 via this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aJBPvdur_WMKtMQNfPduOhoVV_XkXCjOWfYB7MLzEQc/viewform/)

If catching a train to the venue, the nearest train station is Southern Cross Station. After arriving, complete your journey by catching an 11, 12, 48 or 109 tram down Collins Street.
