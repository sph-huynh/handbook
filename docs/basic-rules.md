All UNIHACK competitors must follow these six Basic Rules when competing.
Failure to comply with the Basic Rules can see you removed from the competition
and/or expelled from the venue.

### Rule 1

Teams can have up to four people. Each member of a team must be a student
studying at an undergraduate, honours, or postgraduate course at an accredited
university; or studying at a recognised TAFE.

### Rule 2

Teams have 24 hours to build a working prototype of your project. There are no
restrictions on what form it should take, programming languages or devices.
You must build your project during the allocated time and at the venue. You
cannot have any remote participants.

### Rule 3

Any code must be published in a repository that is publicly accessible. You are
free to use whatever code repository service you want (e.g. GitHub or BitBucket).

### Rule 4

Teams must not work on existing projects during the event. Teams must also not
come into the competition with any code already written, or any part of the build
completed. You are free to conduct research and generate ideas before the
competition, however.

### Rule 5

Any third-party material used must be legally licensed and is available to the
public to download or buy. You may purchase material, tools and equipment for the
competition, but at your own expense. **You will not be reimbursed by UNIHACK or
WIRED Monash**.

### Rule 6

You agree to follow the Code of Conduct and not act in an inappropriate manner.
A copy the Code of Conduct is included.
