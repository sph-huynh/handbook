WIRED Monash is the student club for those studying IT or those who are curious
about everything digital at Monash University Clayton.

We aim to provide a relaxed, social atmosphere where students can meet others
who share their love for everything digital. Our community is one where we can
share our opinions on the latest technology, and collaborate on projects and
competitions.

We also provide our members the opportunity to connect with some of Australia's
leading technology companies through our many sponsored lunchtime events and
networking opportunities - such as our Industry Night.

Past events that we have held include our Annual Trivia Night, Midnight-to-Dawn
Laser Tag, and the hugely successful UNIHACK Melbourne hackathon competition.
We also hold workshops to allow students to expand their knowledge such as data
visualisation and cyber security.

Our club is a registered academic club with Monash Clubs and Societies.
