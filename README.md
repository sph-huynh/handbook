# UNIHACK Competitor Booklet

The UNIHACK Competitor Booklet is built using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) - a simple static site generator that reads files written in Markdown. We use [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) to parse and host the booklet.

## Contribute

In order to contribute, we suggest having a local version of MkDocs. You will need Python 2.7 or Python 3.3+.

Install MkDocs through pip:

```
pip install mkdocs
```

In order to see the changes that you have made, use:

```
mkdocs serve
```

This should emulate the ReadTheDocs look in MkDocs.
